        <p>Hello, my name is James, prior to my current job working as an instructional aide
            at a high school which has been the best job ever. This year is my first year. 
            I was a diesel mechanic for 4 years. I love tinkering and fixing things, and I love
            learning about computers and how the web works. I am excited to learn how to build 
            websites and also applications that can make my life easier and help others.
