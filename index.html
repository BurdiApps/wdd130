        <p>Hello, my name is James. I am currently working as an instructional aide
            at a high school, which has been the best job ever. This year is my first year. 
            I was a diesel mechanic for 4 years and loved it too. I am married to a incredible wife
            and we have 3 beautiful children. I love tinkering and fixing things, and I love
            learning about computers and how the web works. I am excited to learn how to build 
            websites and also applications that can make my life easier and help others. 
        </p>

            California is a state on the West Coast of the United      States, along the Pacific Ocean. It is the most populous state in
            the nation. The four largest cities are Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose. More than three fourths of
            California's population resides in the metropolitan areas of the three largest cities. The state is known for its varied
            climate and geography as well as its diverse population. Approximately half its land is federally owned, with National
            parks and nature reserves scattered throughout the state. Remarkable physical contrasts define the state. Both the
            highest (Mount Whitney in the Sierra Nevada range) and lowest (Death Valley) points in the 48 coterminous states are
            located here. The center of the state is dominated by Central Valley, one of the most productive agricultural areas in
            the world. (New World Encyclopedia)

            <em>I live in the Central Valley in Bakersfield. I have worked in agriculture too!</em> 

            This is the LA Temple. This is where me and my wife got married.
